Running this program:
Input:
Make a file in the working folder called in.txt
Walls should be '#' spaces should be ' ', upstairs should be 'Z', downstairs are 'z', start is 's', end is 'x'. Each row must be on its own line. Seperate floors with at least one empty line. After all floors, the files should end with at least 0 empty lines.

Running:
Delete the old out.txt (or it will be overwritten), run the program with a console/terminal to see time statistics

Output:
The output will be 'u' for up, 'd' for down, 'l' for left, 'r' for right, 'Z' for upstairs, 'z' for downstairs. Starting at the starting point, this should bring you to the end.

Looking at source files:
You can look at our source files without an IDE, but also added Eclipse project files that can be opened as an Eclipse Project

Building the JAR:
If you would like to build the JAR from source, right click on the imported Eclipse project, click export, choose Runnable JAR, and select the option that copies the libraries to a folder next to the JAR (there are no libraries for this project so the folder can be deleted)
